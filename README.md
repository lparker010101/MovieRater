Movie Rater User Story:
As a user I want to be able to create a movie and a tv show. I want the movie and show to be able to tell me as much information about what I am about to watch such as; Title, Year it came out, Parental Guidance, Genre, Description, Main Characters, Rating that I give, and Places I can watch it such as in theaters or on a streaming service. I also want to be able to update a movie just in case I forget to add, or I mistakenly added information on a movie/show. I also want to be able to delete a movie/show if Iâ€™m no longer interested in the movie. Once a movie has been created, I want to be able to rate the movie/show from a range of numbers such as 1 being the lowest rating and 5 being the highest rating. Last, I want to be able to get all movies and tv shows I have created. This way I can see the movies that still needed to be given a rating. If you have time I want to be able to add a movie to a section in my favorites just in case I want to rewatch a movie
